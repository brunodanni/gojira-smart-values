# ü¶ñ gojira-smart-values #

Welcome to the **gojira-smart-values** repository! Here, we harness the colossal power of Jira smart values to automate and streamline your workflows. Just as Godzilla rises from the depths to dominate the landscape, our smart values emerge to conquer your Jira tasks with efficiency and grace.

## Why Gojira? üê≤

Inspired by the legendary monster Godzilla, Jira itself is named after "Gojira," the Japanese name for Godzilla. In this repository, we celebrate this heritage by exploring the vast and mighty potential of Jira smart values.
